# Turn-based Football (Soccer) Game 
## Idea
I first conceived this idea back in 1999 after playing Civilization 1, where I was fascinated by its turn-based mechanic. Inspired by this, I attempted to create something similar using TurboPascal in text mode. Although my initial implementation was unsuccessful and incomplete, I may still have the original source code stored somewhere.

Recently, I decided to revisit this idea, using it as an experimental project for GitHub Copilot. When I began, I sought advice on which framework to use, and JavaScript was recommended. However, since I have limited experience with JavaScript, I opted for TypeScript, as it provides better clarity and understanding of the code for someone with my background.

From that point on, the entire project was developed through GitHub Copilot Sonnet 4. I can't use with Node.js and TypeScript by myself as I have little experience in building web applications, so I was unable to contribute directly to the codebase.

## Experience

The first attempt at building the game was unsuccessful. However, this initial failure allowed me to reflect on my approach and refine the prompts I provided to Copilot.

This process proved to be a valuable learning experience. My initial prompt asked for a "turn-based, in-browser, TypeScript, client-server mode football game." Seeing the prototype helped me identify the design gaps and areas that needed further development.

So in the [next version has been created with much more refined prompt](TBF2\AI-Context.md). It almost work from the start. I had to only decrease a grid size and force it to be rendered correctly, not tilted (hexes are tricky) which actually took me few steps to force in on GitHub Copiliot.

PS: There is an actual game that follows this idea:

It is a little bit different than what I envisioned, but "done is better than perfect" and the game is by far better than anything I could do.
