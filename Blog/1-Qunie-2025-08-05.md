# Quine
A [Quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)) is a program that outputs its own source code. This is not achieved by doing:

```10 LIST```

nor by reading from the source file.

It is a [mathematical fact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene%27s_recursion_theorem) that in every programming language you should be capable of implementing a quine.

!! If you've never tried it - it's a very cool exercise, much trickier than you might think !!

I attempted to write one using GitHub Copilot in both C# and F# to evaluate how AI performance varies between popular and niche languages.

TL;DR: Agnieszka SÅ‚owik was right : LLMs perform better with popular languages.


## C#
All models (GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5, and Sonnet 4) completed the task. Gemini was the one that succeeded on the first attempt.

```
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string s = "using System;\\n\\nclass Program\\n{{\\n    static void Main()\\n    {{\\n        string s = {0}{1}{0};\\n        Console.Write(s, (char)34, s);\\n    }}\\n}}\\n";
        Console.Write(s.Replace("\\n", "\n"), (char)34, s);
    }
}
```

## F# 
I asked the models to re-implement it in F#.
1. Sonnet 4 was the only model that was able to complete it, after several interactions with the compiler.
```
open System

[<EntryPoint>]
let main args =
    let s = "open System{0}{0}[<EntryPoint>]{0}let main args ={0}    let s = \"{1}\"{0}    printfn \"%s\" (System.String.Format(s, System.Environment.NewLine, s.Replace(\"\\\\\", \"\\\\\\\\\").Replace(\"\\\"\", \"\\\\\\\"\"))){0}    0"
    printfn "%s" (System.String.Format(s, System.Environment.NewLine, s.Replace("\\", "\\\\").Replace("\"", "\\\"")))
    0
```
2. GPT-4.1 ended up oscillating between two incorrect F# syntaxes (the type system is more restrictive).
```
[<EntryPoint>]
let main argv =
    let s = "[<EntryPoint>]\nlet main argv =\n    let s = %c%s%c\n    printf s 34 s 34\n    0\n" in
    printf s 34 s 34
    0
```
3. Gemini 2.5 initially had a similar problem to GPT but then simply stopped responding.
```
let s = "let s = {0}{1}{0}; System.Console.Write(s, (char)34, s)"
System.Console.Write(s, (char)34, s)
```z
